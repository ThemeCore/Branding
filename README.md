 #### While different parts of the ThemeCore™ project are covered by various approved open source licenses, our logos, icons, miscellaneous graphics, and other media are not. As such, these forms of media have specific guidelines for both usage and reproduction.

 #### Most of the various forms of media in this repository are either trademarked (™), or are registered trademarks (®) of the ThemeCore™ project. The ThemeCore™ project itself was created by [Erik Roth](https://github.com/Erik-Rothh) [<img src="docs/images/github.svg" style="height: 15px;" title="GitHub Link">]() [LIn]() and is currently trademarked by [RL Technologies, LLC](https://rltechsllc.com)

#### Why are some things trademarked and not fully open source?

ThemeCore™ was conceived, and is being actively developed as a brand for a complete WordPress™ theme and plugin development solution. As such, the images, color palettes, layouts, etc for the brand were trademarked to provide consistency and recognizability in the representation of the brand. In addition, this provides continued protection of the ThemeCore™ brand, helping to ensure its reputation in the community.

#### Can I use the ThemeCore™ branding in my projects?

Yes, and no. It all depends on how and why you wish to use the branding. We have developed a '[Trademark and Branding Policy]()' to help you decide wether or not using the ThemeCore™ branding is acceptable for your project, website, or anywhere else you wish to use our branding. If you are unsure about anything contained in the policy guidelines, you can always send us an email at <branding@themecore.org>.

#### Do you accept ideas or contributions to the branding?

Yes, however since the branding is trademarked, there are special requirements and terms of use for branding submissions and contributions. To find out exactly what is required you can read up on the requirements and expectations in our '[Contribution Policy]()', and our '[Submission Policy]()'. If you find the terms and requirements in the policies are acceptable, we would love to have you on board with our team. 

#### If it's all trademarked, why bother with master files and a branding repository?

Because, in the spirit of open source, we feel all the files for the ThemeCore™ project should be made available. It also provides us with a central point to keep the files available for those who wish to use them as a learning tool, as well as a place to store revisions so those in the future will know how it all started and evolved.
